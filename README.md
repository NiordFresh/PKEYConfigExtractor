# PKEYConfigExtractor
PKEYConfigExtractor is a WPF-based utility designed to generate Windows product keys using embedded PKEY configuration data (.xrm-ms files). By leveraging official PKEYConfig structures and an external Python-based key generator (keycutter), it allows users to produce valid-looking product keys for various Windows editions.

Requirements:

- .NET Framework 4.5.2 or higher  
- Python interpreter (required for key generation via the bundled keycutter script)

The application features an intuitive graphical interface built with Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF), enabling easy loading of .xrm-ms files, selection of target editions, and bulk key generation with customizable or randomized serial/security values.
