# PKEYConfigExtractor
PKEYConfigExtractor is a WPF-based utility designed to generate Windows product keys using embedded PKEY configuration data (.xrm-ms files). Unlike earlier approaches that relied on external Python scripts, this tool integrates a high-performance key generation engine rewritten entirely in Go (Golang). By leveraging official PKEYConfig structures and implementing core cryptographic logic in Go for improved speed and reliability, it enables users to produce valid-looking product keys for various Windows editions—without external dependencies or runtime overhead.
